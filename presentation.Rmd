## Finding 1

Student body size drecreased until most recent school year, while referrals and suspensions increased until most recent year, when each pattern reversed.

```{r}
demos_tidy %>% 
  filter(!category %in% c("IEP", "ELLs")) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  mutate(type = "total students") %>% 
  bind_rows(discipline) %>% 
  mutate(type = fct_relevel(type, "total students", 
                            "referrals",
                            "suspensions")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, group = type, color = type)) + 
    geom_line(size = 2) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Referrals follow opposite pattern of student body",
                          30), 
         color = NULL,
         x = "school year") + 
    jtc
```

## Finding 2 

Substantial increase in the percent of White students. 

```{r}
demos_tidy %>% 
  filter(year %in% c("2013-2014", "2016-2017")) %>% 
  select(-pct, -total) %>% 
  spread(year, count) %>% 
  mutate(pct_change = (`2016-2017` - `2013-2014`) / `2013-2014`, 
         category = recode(category, Other = "other race"),
         type = if_else(str_detect(category, "ELLs|IEP"),
                                   "support services",
                                   "race"),
         category = str_wrap(category, 10), 
         category = fct_reorder(category, as.numeric(factor(type)))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(category, pct_change)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3, 3)) +
    labs(y = "percent change",
         x = "category", 
         title = "Change in demographic categories",
         subtitle = "SY13-14 to SY1617") + 
    jtc
```

## Finding 3

Test scores decrease when the student body is more African-American, but increase with each other category. 

```{r}

test_scores <- out %>% 
  filter(str_detect(obs, "prof")) 

model <- lm(pct ~ obs, data = test_scores)

test_scores %>% 
  add_predictions(model) %>% 
  add_residuals(model) %>% 
  left_join(demos_tidy %>% rename(pct_demo = pct), by = "year") %>% 
  mutate(category = recode(category, Other = "other race"),
         type = if_else(str_detect(category, "ELLs|IEP"),
                                   "support services",
                                   "race"),
         category = fct_reorder(category, as.numeric(factor(type)))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pct_demo, resid)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) + 
    geom_smooth(aes(color = category), show.legend = FALSE, size = 1.5,
                method = "glm", se = FALSE) + 
    facet_wrap(~category, scales = "free_x") +
    labs(title = "Test scores change with demographics", 
         x = "percent category",
         y = "residuals - test scores") + 
    jtc +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 11))

```

## Hypotheses
#### Changes in neighborhood context
- Steady increase in White students and decrease in African-American students suggest changing neighorhood demographics

#### Changes in district policy
- Increase in student body sizein most recent year suggest changes in district policy such as catchment zone or other school closing

#### Changes in school context
- Changes in discipline referrals suggest change in leadership or discipline policy
